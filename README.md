# Set

Set (stylized as SET) is a real-time card game designed by Marsha Falco in 1974 and published by Set Enterprises in 1991. 
The deck consists of 81 unique cards that vary in four features across three possibilities for each kind of feature:
number of shapes (one, two, or three), 
shape (diamond, squiggle, oval), 
shading (solid, striped, or open), 
and color (red, green, or purple).
Each possible combination of features (e.g. a card with [three] [striped] [green] [diamonds]) appears as a card precisely once in the deck.

Bonus game: Concentration. It's main purpose is to make match between two similar cards. Whenever two cards are selected,
the next user's tap on a hidden card automatically flips them over. If there is a match, two cards leave the table.
